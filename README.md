# Weather-Forecast
Current weather and forecast for the next 5 days(using Flask)
I apologize for the misunderstanding. Here's a textual description of the project's content without the actual code:

**Project Description: Weather Forecast Web Application**

This project is a web application that provides users with weather forecasts for a specified location. The application is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and it utilizes data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

**Key Features:**

1. **Web Interface:** The application presents its features through a user-friendly web interface.

2. **Location Input:** Users can input the location (city or place) for which they want to retrieve the weather forecast. The input is provided through a text input field.

3. **Current Weather:** The application displays the current weather conditions for the specified location. This includes information such as temperature in degrees Celsius, humidity percentage, a brief weather description, and an icon representing the current weather conditions.

4. **Weather Forecast:** The project also provides a weather forecast for upcoming days. It presents a table that includes columns for the date, temperature in degrees Celsius, humidity percentage, a description of the weather, and icons representing the weather conditions.

**Functionality:**

- Upon initial access, the application displays the weather forecast for a default location, which is "Chennai."
- Users can change the location by typing a new location in the text input field and clicking the "Get Weather" button.
- The application makes an API request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for the specified location.
- It then formats the retrieved data to extract the relevant information for the current weather and the forecast.
- The formatted weather data is displayed on the web page for the user to view.

**Usage:**

1. Open the web application in a web browser.
2. The default weather forecast for "Chennai" is displayed.
3. To view the weather forecast for a different location:
   - Enter the desired location (e.g., "New York") in the text input field.
   - Click the "Get Weather" button.
4. The page will refresh, and the weather forecast for the newly specified location will be displayed.

This project allows users to access weather information for different locations by interacting with the web application. It provides a simple and intuitive way to check the weather forecast and is suitable for various use cases, such as trip planning and daily weather updates.
